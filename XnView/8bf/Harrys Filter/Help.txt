QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
==================

* The Grup and FX combo boxes:
The first box contains the main groups of filters, while the second box lets you select a specific filter effect. With both boxes you can select each of the 69 included filters.

* The up to eight sliders:
Use them to adjust the image effect.

* The Brightness slider and Blend feature:
The Brightness slider lets you adjust the brightness of the image. The combo box below lets you choose one of 20 blending methods. The slider to the right defines the blending ratio.

* The numbers at the left corner of the preview:
The first number indicates the time in miliseconds that was needed to calculate the effect. The second number is the maximum number of frames per second that your processor can render at the current zoom level. Finally, the third number is the estmated time that it would need to render the effect to the image.

* The Zoom buttons:
You can choose a zoom setting from 6% to 100%. By default the image is fit into the preview.

* The Instant Preview check box:
If it is activated it will display the effect while you drag a slider. If the rendering is too slow or inconveniant, you can deactivate this check box.

* The Play Button:
Display as an animation in the preview. The animation is produced with the help of random slider settings. While the animation plays you can use the other controls. e.g. change the zoom, drag a slider, change the effect. To stop the animation, click on the same button again. The Play button is a nice way to see what effects a filter can produce and a big help for finding an fitting effect. If you have a slow computer, try decreasing the zoom to make the animation run more smoother.

* The f/s and Speed combo boxes:
The two combo boxes left of the Play button let you influence the animation. The f/s combo box lets you choose the number of frames per second that are displayed. The "Auto f/s" option automatically chooses a frame rate that is suitable for your computer's processor. The Speed combo box lets you choose the speed with which the animation is running. You can choose a speed from "Slower" to "Faster".

* The Jump button:
Clicking on it generates random slider settings.

* The ? button:
Displays this file

* The Open and Save buttons:
The Save button displays a file dialog for saving the current slider settings as a preset file. The Open button lets you restore settings from a preset file. The saved preset files have the file extension .HFP and are 13 or 14 bytes large. Several preset files are already delivered with Harry's Filters. The 10 byte large preset files from Version 2.0 of Harry's Filters are still supported, but some may not produce the same effect, because some slider ranges have been altered in Version 3.0.

* The OK and Cancel buttons
OK applies the current effect and Cancel exits the plugin.
