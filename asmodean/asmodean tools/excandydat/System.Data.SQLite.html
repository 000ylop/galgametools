    ADO.NET 2.0/3.5 SQLite Data Provider<br>
    Version 1.0.65.0 July 26, 2009<br>
    Using SQLite 3.6.16<br>
    Written by Robert Simpson (<a href="mailto:robert@blackcastlesoft.com">robert@blackcastlesoft.com</a>)<br>
    Released to the public domain, use at your own risk!<br>
    Official provider website:&nbsp; <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com">http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com</a><br />
    <br>
    The latest version can be downloaded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlite-dotnet2">
      here</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b></b>
    <h2>
      <b>Features:</b><br>
    </h2>
    <UL>
      <LI>
      Written from scratch on VS2008 specifically for ADO.NET 2.0, implementing all the
      base classes and features recently introduced in the framework, including automatic
      transaction enlistment.<li>Supports the Full
        and Compact .NET Framework, and native C/C++ development.&nbsp; 100% binary
        compatible with the original sqlite3.dll.</li>
      <li>Full support for Mono via a &quot;managed only&quot; provider that runs against the 
        official SQLite 3.6.1 or higher library.</li>
      <li>Full Entity Framework support (ADO.NET 3.5 SP1)</li>
      <LI>
      On the Compact Framework, it is faster than Sql Server 
      Mobile.  SQLite's installed size is a fraction of Sql Mobile's. It uses less memory at runtime, runs queries faster, and has a smaller database file size as well.
      <li>Encrypted database support.&nbsp; Encrypted databases are fully encrypted and
        support both binary and cleartext password types.</li>
      <LI>
      Visual Studio 2005/2008 Design-Time Support, works with all versions of VS2005/2008,
        including
      all Express Editions of VS2005.&nbsp; You can add a SQLite 
      database to the Servers list, design queries with the Query Designer, 
      drag-and-drop tables onto a Typed DataSet, etc.<LI>
        Full SQLite schema editing inside Visual Studio.&nbsp;
        You can create/edit tables, views, triggers, indexes, check constraints and foreign keys.<LI>
      Single file redistributable (except on Compact Framework).&nbsp; The core sqlite3 codebase and the ADO.NET wrapper 
      are combined into one multi-module assembly.
      <LI>
              Binaries included for Itanium, x64, x86 and ARM processors.<LI>
      DbProviderFactory support.
      <LI>
        Full support for ATTACH'ed databases.&nbsp; Exposed as <I>Catalogs</I>
      in the schema.&nbsp; When cloning a connection, all attached databases are 
      automatically re-attached to the new connection.
      <LI>
        DbConnection.GetSchema(...) support includes <I>ReservedWords, MetaDataCollections</I>, <I>DataSourceInformation</I>,
        <I>DataTypes, Columns</I>, <I>Tables</I>, <I>Views, ViewColumns, </I><I>Catalogs, </I><I>Indexes, 
          IndexColumns, </I><EM>ForeignKeys </EM>and<EM> Triggers</EM>.
      <LI>
      Enhanced DbDataReader.GetSchemaTable() functionality returns catalog, namespace 
      and detailed schema information even for complex queries.
      <LI>
      Named and unnamed parameters.
      <LI>
      Full UTF-8 and UTF-16 support, each with optimized pipelines into the native 
      database core.
      <LI>
      Multiple simultaneous DataReaders (one DataReader per Command however).
      <LI>
      Full support for user-defined scalar and aggregate functions, encapsulated into 
      an easy-to-use base class in which only a couple of overrides are necessary to 
      implement new SQL functions.
      <LI>
      Full support for user-defined collating sequences, every bit as simple to 
      implement as user-defined functions and uses the same base class.
      <LI>
        Full source for the entire engine and wrapper.&nbsp; No copyrights.&nbsp; 
        Public Domain.&nbsp; 100% free for commercial and non-commercial use.&nbsp;</LI></UL>
    <strong></strong>
    <h2>
      <strong>Design-Time Support</strong></h2>
    <P>
      In Windows Explorer, navigate to the <STRONG>SQLite.NET\bin\Designer</STRONG>
        folder and execute the <STRONG>INSTALL.EXE</STRONG>
      file.&nbsp; The program will
      automatically detect what version(s) of Visual Studio 2005/2008 are installed and allow
      you to selectively install and uninstall the designer for each edition.</P>
    <H2><STRONG>DbFactory Support (Non-Compact Framework)</STRONG></H2>
    In order to use the SQLiteFactory and have the SQLite data provider enumerated 
    in the DbProviderFactories methods, you must add the following segment into your application's app.config file:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.data&gt;
    &lt;DbProviderFactories&gt;
      &lt;remove invariant="System.Data.SQLite"/&gt;
      &lt;add name="SQLite Data Provider" invariant="System.Data.SQLite" description=".Net Framework Data Provider for SQLite"<BR > type="System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteFactory, System.Data.SQLite" /&gt;
    &lt;/DbProviderFactories&gt;
  &lt;/system.data&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
    <p>See the help documentation for further details on implementing both version-specific (GAC enabled) and version independent DBProviderFactories support.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Compiling for the Compact Framework</h3>
    <p>
      Just change the target platform from Win32 to Compact Framework and 
      recompile.&nbsp; <STRONG>The Compact Framework has no support for enumerating 
        attributes in an assembly, therefore all user-defined collating sequences and 
        functions must be explicitly registered.</STRONG>&nbsp; See the <STRONG>testce</STRONG>
      sample application for an example of how to explicitly register user-defined 
      collating sequences and functions.</p>
    <h2>
      <b><A name="redist"></A>Distributing The SQLite Engine and ADO.NET Assembly</b></h2>
    <P>
      On the desktop, only the <STRONG>System.Data.SQLite.DLL</STRONG> file needs to be distributed with your 
      application(s).&nbsp; This DLL contains both the managed wrapper and the native 
      SQLite3 codebase.&nbsp; For the Compact Framework, you will have to distribute 
      both the CF version of System.Data.SQLite.DLL, as well as the 
      SQLite.Interop.XXX.DLL.&nbsp; This is a breaking change as of 1.0.59.0.&nbsp; 
      Recent Windows Mobile frameworks are not supporting the mixed CF assembly I was 
      building prior to this version.</P>
    <H2><B>Development Notes Regarding the SQLite 3 Source Code</B></H2>
    <p>
      The core sqlite engine is compiled directly from the unmodified source code available
      at the sqlite.org website.&nbsp; Several additional pieces are compiled on top of
      it to extend its functionality, but the core engine's source is not changed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <b>Version History</b></p>
    <p><b>1.0.65.0 - July 26, 2009</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the encryption module to prevent a double free() when rekeying a database.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the encryption module when ATTACHing an encrypted database.</li>
      <li>Incorporated the WinCE locking fix from ticket
        <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3991">#3991</a></li>
      <li>Added &quot;bigint&quot; to the dropdown in the table designer, plus other minor table 
        designer bugfixes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.64.0 - July 9, 2009</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the missing resources problem from the 63 release.</li>
      <li>Added preliminary support for the Visual Studio 2010 beta.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in SQLiteCommand that threw a null reference exception when 
        setting the Transaction object to null.</li>
      <li>If SQLiteConnection.EnlistTransaction is called multiple times for the same 
        transaction scope, just return without throwing an error.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.63.0 - June 29, 2009</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.16</li>
      <li>Check the autocommit mode of the connection to which a transaction is bound 
        during the disposal of the transaction.&nbsp; If autocommit is enabled, then the 
        database has already rolled back the transaction and we don&#39;t need to do it 
        during dispose, and can quietly ignore the step without throwing an error.</li>
      <li>Eliminated the mergebin step altogether.&nbsp; It was developed primarily to 
        merge the Compact Framework binaries together, but since we&#39;re not doing that 
        anymore, its use is limited.&nbsp; Its non-standard method of merging a binary 
        on the desktop framework is redundant as well.&nbsp; The desktop binary now 
        hard-links to MSCOREE, but as of Windows XP, this was redundant as well since XP 
        and beyond automatically attempt to load MSCOREE on startup when a DLL has a 
        .NET header.</li>
      <li>More improvements to the test.exe program for running the tests against Sql 
        Server for comparison purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.62.0 - June 19, 2009</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.15</li>
      <li>Fixed the decimal reading bug in the SQLiteDataReader</li>
      <li>Changed Join()&#39;s to Sleep()&#39;s in the statement retry code to prevent message 
        pumping</li>
      <li>Fixed a bad pointer conversion when retrieving blobs using GetBytes() in 
        64-bit land</li>
      <li>Several changes to the Test program that comes with the provider.&nbsp; Tests 
        can now be individually disabled, and the test program can run against several 
        provider back-ends</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.61.0 - April 28, 2009</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.13.  The new backup features are as yet unimplemented in the provider, but will be forthcoming in a subsequent release</li>
      <li>Fixed the default-value lookups in SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder when accessing properties</li>
      <li>Lock the SQLiteTransaction object during dispose to avoid potential race condition during cleanup</li>
      <li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader.GetDecimal() processing and parsing of decimal values for cases when SQLite returns things like "1.0e-05" instead of "0.0001"</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.60.0 - October 3, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Throw a NotSupported exception in the EF Sql Gen code instead of parsing 
        illegal SQL during an update/insert/delete where no primary key is defined.</li>
      <li>Fixed the Compact Framework interop library.&nbsp; Since the linker flag 
        /subsystem had no version specified, it was causing a problem for many CE-based 
        platforms.</li>
      <li>Incorporated SQLite patch for ticket
        <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3387">#3387</a> and reverted 
        out the vfs override code I added in build 59 to work around this problem.</li>
      <li>Fixed a designer issue when creating a new table from the Server Explorer.&nbsp; 
        After initially saving it, if you then continued to edit it and tried to save it 
        again, it would generate the change SQL using the old temporary table name 
        rather than the new name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.59.0 - September 22, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.3.&nbsp; Solves 
        a couple different EF issues that were either giving inconsistent results or 
        crashing the engine.</li>
      <li>Fixed the parsing of literal binaries in the EF SqlGen code.&nbsp; SQLite now 
        passes nearly all the testcases in 
        <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/1377/5921.aspx#5921">Microsoft's EF Query Samples</a> application -- 
        the exception being the <i>datetimeoffset </i>and<i> time</i> constants tests, and tests 
        that use the <i>APPLY </i>keyword which are unsupported for now.</li>
      <li>Revamped the Compact Framework mixed-mode assembly.&nbsp; Tired of playing cat 
        and mouse with the Compact Framework&#39;s support for mixed-mode assemblies.&nbsp; 
        The CF build now requires that you distribute both the System.Data.SQLite 
        library and the paired SQLite.Interop.XXX library.&nbsp;&nbsp; The XXX denotes 
        the build number of the library.</li>
      <li>Implemented a workaround for Vista&#39;s overzealous caching by turning off 
        FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS for OS versions above XP.&nbsp; This is implemented 
        as a custom (default override) VFS in the interop.c file, so no changes are made 
        to the SQLite source code.</li>
      <li>Fixed some registry issues in the designer install.exe, which prevented some 
        design-time stuff from working on the Compact Framework when .NET 3.5 was 
        installed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.58.0 - August 30, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.2.&nbsp; If only I&#39;d waited one more day to release 
        57!&nbsp; Several LINQ issues have been resolved with this engine release 
        relating to deeply-nested subqueries that the EF SqlGen creates.</li>
      <li>The Rollback SQLiteConnection event no longer requires an open connection in 
        order to subscribe to it.&nbsp; Missed this one in the 57 release.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.57.0 - August 29, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compiled against 3.6.1 with checkin
        <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3300">#3300</a> resolved, 
        which fixes an Entity Framework bug I was seeing.&nbsp; I currently have 3 other 
        tickets out on the engine, which are not yet resolved and relate to EF.</li>
      <li>Fixed decimal types to store and fetch using InvariantCulture.&nbsp; If you&#39;re 
        using decimal datatypes in your database and were affected by the 56 release, 
        please issue an UPDATE &lt;table&gt; SET &lt;column&gt; = REPLACE(&lt;column&gt;, &#39;,&#39;, &#39;.&#39;);&nbsp; 
        to fix the decimal separators.&nbsp; Apologies for not testing that more 
        thoroughly before releasing 56.</li>
      <li>Too many LINQ fixes to list.&nbsp; Fixed views so they generate, 
        fixed the LIMIT clause, implemented additional functionality and removed unnecessary code.</li>
      <li>Fixed foreign key names in the designer so viewing the SQL script on a new 
        unsaved table after renaming it in the properties toolwindow will reflect in the 
        script properly.</li>
      <li>Fixed the Update and Commit events on SQLiteConnection so they don&#39;t require 
        the connection to be opened first.</li>
      <li>Fixed userdef aggregate functions so they play nice with each other when 
        appearing multiple times in the same statement.</li>
      <li>Fixed the editing and saving of default values in the table designer.</li>
      <li>Fixed ForeignKeys schema to support multi-column foreign keys.&nbsp; Also 
        hacked support for them in the table designer, provided two foreign keys in the 
        designer have the same name and reference the same foreign table and different 
        columns.&nbsp; Will implement first-class support for this in the next release.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.56.0 - August 11, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the table designer when designing new tables, wherein you had to 
        save the table first before being able to create indexes and foreign keys.</li>
      <li>Tweaks to decimal type handling.&nbsp; The &#39;decimal&#39; type can&#39;t be represented 
        by Int64 or Double (without loss of precision) in SQLite, so we have to fudge it 
        by treating it like a string and converting it back and forth in the provider.&nbsp; 
        Unfortunately backing it to the db as a string causes sorting problems.&nbsp; 
        See <a href="http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/forums/p/1296/5595.aspx#5595">this 
        post</a> 
        for details on using a custom collation sequence to overcome the sorting issue arising from this patch.</li>
      <li>Minor tweaks and bugfixes to the test program and the provider.</li>
      <li>More adjustments to make the managed-only version of the provider run and pass 
        all tests on Mono.</li>
      <li>LINQ to Entities bits heavily updated and compiled against VS2008 SP1 RTM.&nbsp; SQLite 
        LINQ support is still considered beta.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.55.0 - August 6, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.1</li>
      <li>Added support for the user-contributed extension-functions at
        <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/contrib">http://www.sqlite.org/contrib</a>.&nbsp; 
        Feel free to override any of them with your own implementation.&nbsp; The new 
        functions are: <i>acos, asin, atan, atn2, atan2, acosh, asinh, atanh, 
        difference, degrees, radians, cos, sin, tan, cot, cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, exp, 
        log, log10, power, sign, sqrt, square, ceil, floor, pi, replicate, charindex, 
        leftstr, rightstr, reverse, proper, padl, padr, padc, strfilter,</i> and 
        aggregates <i>stdev, variance, mode, median, lower_quartile, upper_quartile.</i></li>
      <li>Moved the last_rows_affected() function to the C extension library.</li>
      <li>Added a new class, SQLiteFunctionEx which extends SQLiteFunction and adds the 
        ability for a user-defined function to get the collating sequence during the 
        Invoke/Step methods.&nbsp; User-defined functions can use the collating sequence 
        as a helper to compare values.</li>
      <li>When registering user-defined collation sequences and functions, the provider 
        will now register both a UTF8 and a UTF16 version instead of just UTF8.</li>
      <li>Revamped connection pooling and added static ClearPool() and ClearAllPools() 
        functions to SQLiteConnection.&nbsp; Behavior of the pool and its clearing 
        mechanics match SqlClient.</li>
      <li>Fixed connections going to the pool so that any unfinalized lingering commands 
        from un-collected datareaders are automatically reset and any lurking 
        transactions made on the connection are rolled back.</li>
      <li>Transaction isolation levels are now partially supported.&nbsp; Serializable 
        is the default, which obtains read/write locks immediately -- this is compatible 
        with previous releases of the provider.&nbsp; Unspecified will default to 
        whatever the default isolation mode is set to, and ReadCommitted will cause a 
        deferred lock to be obtained.&nbsp; No other values are legal.</li>
      <li>Revamped the test.exe program.&nbsp; It&#39;s now an interactive GUI application.&nbsp; 
        Easier for me to add tests now.</li>
      <li>Tweaks to the VS designer package and installer.</li>
      <li>More adjustments to the internal SQLite3.Prepare() method to account for both 
        kinds of lock errors when retrying.</li>
      <li>Stripped a lot of unnecessary interop() calls and replaced with base sqlite calls.&nbsp; 
        Revamped most of UnsafeNativeMethods to make it easier to port the code.</li>
      <li>Rerigged internal callbacks for userdef functions and other native to managed 
        callbacks.&nbsp; More portable this way.</li>
      <li>Source can now can be compiled with the SQLITE_STANDARD preprocessor symbol to 
        force the wrapper to use the stock sqlite3 library.&nbsp; Some functionality is 
        missing, but its minimal.&nbsp; None of the precompiled binaries are compiled 
        using this setting, but its useful for testing portability.</li>
      <li>Added &quot;boolean&quot; and a couple other missing datatypes to the &quot;DataTypes&quot; schema 
        xml file.&nbsp; Used by the VS designer when displaying tables and querying.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Read Only&quot;.&nbsp; When set to True, the 
        database will be opened in read-only mode.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Max Pool Size&quot; to set the maximum size 
        of the connection pool for a given db file connection.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string option &quot;Default IsolationLevel&quot; to set the 
        default isolation level of transactions.&nbsp; Possible values are Serializable and 
        ReadCommitted.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string option &quot;URI&quot; as an optional parameter for 
        compatibility with other ports of the provider.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.54.0 - July 25, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the setup project, which somehow &quot;forgot&quot; to include all the binaries in 
        the 53 release.</li>
      <li>Fixed a crash in the table designer when creating a new table and tabbing past 
        the &quot;Allow Nulls&quot; cell in the grid while creating a new column.</li>
      <li>Fixed a mostly-benign bug in SQLiteDataReader&#39;s GetEnumerator, which failed to 
        pass along a flag to the underyling DbEnumerator it creates.&nbsp; This one&#39;s 
        been around since day 1 and nobody&#39;s noticed it in all these years.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string parameter &quot;Journal Mode&quot; that allows you to set 
        the SQLite journal mode to Delete, Persist or Off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.53.0 - July 24, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enabled sqlite_load_extension</li>
      <li>Added retry/timeout code to SQLite3.Prepare() when preparing statements for 
        execution and a SQLITE_BUSY error occurs.</li>
      <li>Added a new schema to SQLiteConnection.GetSchema() called <i>Triggers</i>.&nbsp; 
        Used to retrieve the trigger(s) associated with a database and/or table/view.</li>
      <li>Extensive updates to table/view editing capabilities inside Visual Studio&#39;s 
        Server Explorer.&nbsp; The program now parses and lets you edit CHECK constraints and 
        triggers on a table, as well as define triggers on views.&nbsp; Experimental 
        still, so e-mail me if you have issues.</li>
      <li>Minor bugfix to the ViewColumns schema to return the proper base column name 
        for a view that aliases a column.</li>
      <li>Fixed the insert/update/delete DML support in the Linq module.</li>
      <li>Changed the behavior of SQLiteCommand to allow a transaction to be set even if 
        the command hasn&#39;t been associated with a connection yet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.52.0 - July 16, 2008</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.6.0</li>
      <li>Added a lot of previously-missing exports to the DEF file for the 
        native library.</li>
      <li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader to check for an invalid connection before operating on 
        an open cursor.</li>
      <li>Implemented the Cancel() function of SQLiteCommand to cancel an active reader.</li>

        edit/create tables and views, manage indexes and foreign keys from Visual Studio.&nbsp; 
        This feature is still undergoing testing so use at your own risk!</li>
      <li>Fixed the Server Explorer so VS2005 users can once again right-click tables 
        and views and open the table data.</li>
      <li>Added some new interop code to assist in returning more metadata not normally 
        available through the SQLite API.&nbsp; Specifically, index column sort modes 
        and collating sequences.&nbsp; Also added code to detect (but not parse) CHECK 
        constraints, so the table designer can pop up a warning when editing a table 
        with these constraints.&nbsp; Since I can&#39;t currently parse them.</li>
      <li>Lots of LINQ SQL generation improvements and fixes.</li>
      <li>Made some progress cleaning up and fixing up the schema definitions and 
        manifests for EdmGen.</li>
      <li>Added a built-in SQLiteFunction called last_rows_affected() which can be 
        called from SQL to get the number of rows affected by the last update/insert 
        operation on the connection.&nbsp; This is roughly equivalent to Sql Server&#39;s

        finished rigging everything up yet.&nbsp; The core library remains stable.&nbsp; 
        All LINQ-specific code is completely separate from the core.</li>

      <li>Enhanced the mergebin utility to work around the strong name validation bug on 
        the Compact Framework.&nbsp; The old workaround kludged the DLL and caused WM6.1

      <li>Added support for a new DateTime type, JulianDay.&nbsp; SQLite uses Julian dates
        internally.</li>
      <li>Added a new connection string parameter "Default Timeout" and a corresponding
        method on the SQLiteConnection object to change the default command timeout.&nbsp;
        This is especially useful for changing the timeout on transactions, which use SQLiteCommand
        objects internally and have no ADO.NET-friendly way to adjust the command timeout

        VS2005 SDK so one or two bells and whistles are missing, but nothing significant.</li>
      <li>This is the last version that the FTS1 and FTS2 extensions will appear.&nbsp;
        Everyone should rebuild their fulltext indexes using the new FTS3 module.&nbsp;
        FTS1 and FTS2 suffer from a design flaw that could cause database corruption with
        certain vacuum operations.</li>
      <li>Fixed pooled connections so they rollback any outstanding transactions before
        going to the pool.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Fixed the unintended breaking of the TYPES keyword, and mis-typing of untyped
        or indeterminate column types. </li>
      <li>Assert a FileIOPermission() requirement in the static SQLiteFunction constructor.
      </li>
      <li>The CE-only SQLiteFunction.RegisterFunction() is now available on the desktop
        platform for dynamic registration of functions.&nbsp; You must still close and re-open
        a connection in order for the new function to be seen by a connection.</li>
      <li>Fixed the "database is locked" errors by implementing behavioral changes in the
        interop.c file for SQLite.&nbsp; Closing a database force-finalizes any prepared
        statements on the database to ensure the connection is fully closed.&nbsp; This
        was rather tricky because the GC thread could still be finalizing statements itself.

      null, table, index } instead of {catalog, null, table, null, index}</li>
      <li>Code merge with SQLite 3.4.2</li>
      <li>Fixed some errors in the encryption module, most notably when a non-default page
        size is specified in the connection string. </li>
      <li>Fixed SQLiteDataReader to better handle type-less usage scenarios, which also
        fixes problems with null values and datetimes.</li>
      <li>Fixed the leftover temp files problem on WinCE </li>
      <li>Added connection pooling.&nbsp; The default is disabled for now, but may change
      in the future.&nbsp; Set "Pooling=True" in the connection string to enable it. </li>
      <li>Sped up SQLiteConnection.Open() considerably.</li>
      <li>Added some more robust cleanup code regarding SQLiteFunctions.</li>
      <li>Minor additions to the code to allow for future LINQ integration into the main

      <li>Fixed a long-standing bug in the Open() command of SQLiteConnection which failed
      to honor the documented default behavior of the SQLite.NET provider to open the
      database in "Synchronous=Normal" mode.&nbsp; The default was "Full". </li>
      <li>If Open() fails, it no longer sets the connection state to Broken.&nbsp; It instead
        reverts back to Closed, and cleans up after itself.</li>
      <li>Added several new parameters to the ConnectionString for setting max page count,
        legacy file format, and another called FailIfMissing to raise an error rather than
        create the database file automatically if it does not already exist.</li>
      <li>Fixed some designer toolbox references to the wrong version of the SQLite.Designer</li>

      <li>Small enhancements to the TYPES keyword, and added documentation for it in the
        help file.</li>
      <li>Hopefully fixed the occasional SQLITE_BUSY errors that cropped up when starting

        ended with a semi-colon or had other non-parsable comments at the end of a statement&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Fixed an intermittent multi-threaded race condition between the garbage collector
        thread and the main application thread which lead to an occasional SQLITE_MISUSE
        error.</li>
      <li>Fixed another issue relating to SQLite's inherent typelessness when dealing with
        aggregate functions which could return Int64 or Double or even String for a given
        row depending on what was aggregated.</li>

    <li>Fixed a bug when doing data binding in Compact Framework projects that prevented
      you from assigning a typed dataset to a bindingsource.&nbsp; It turns out, the CF
      version of the SQLite provider needs to be flagged as retargetable so it'll work
      in the design-time desktop environment.&nbsp; No changes were made to the desktop
      build, but the revision was bumped on all libraries anyway in order to keep them
      sync'd.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <li>Many optimizations and a few more minor adjustments to schemas and schema retrieval
      performance.</li>
      <li>Lots of design-time attributes added to the code.&nbsp; The DbDataAdapter, DbCommand,
        and DbConnection objects now have greatly enhanced design-time capabilities when
        added to the toolbox and dropped on a form.</li>
      <li>Lots of Server Explorer enhancements.</li>

    <ul>
    <li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.2 beta.</li><li>Eliminated the static linking of mscoree from all binaries.&nbsp; Native projects
      can now use the library without any dependencies on the .NET framework, while managed
      projects continue to be able to use the library normally.</li></ul>
    <p><b>1.0.24.5 beta - January 20, 2006</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.1 alpha and contains development-in-progress code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees
      can be made regarding its suitability for production use.</li>
    <li><strong>You no longer need to distribute 2 files on the CompactFramework.&nbsp;
      You can delete SQLite.Interop.DLL entirely.&nbsp; </strong>I wrote a custom tool
      called "mergebin" (available in the source zip file) which combines the two libraries
      and gets around a glaring defect in the VS2005 linker for ARM processors which doesn't
      allow you to link netmodules.</li>
      <li><strong>x64 and ia64 builds now use the same strong name as the x86 build.</strong>&nbsp;
        This means breaking backward compatibility, but it was necessary in order to allow
        you to drop any of those 3 builds onto a PC and have your .NET program run properly.&nbsp;
        Prior to this, you'd get an error if you built your program using the x86 build,
        and then installed the x64 version on a target machine and tried to run your program
        against it.</li>
      <li>The entire source project has been gone over top to bottom.&nbsp; A debug build
        no longer combines the binaries into a single module, which was preventing proper
        debugging.</li></ul>
    <p><b>1.0.24.4 beta - January 16, 2006</b></p>

    <li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.1 alpha and contains development-in-progress code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees
      can be made regarding its suitability for production use.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the UTF-16 handling code for preparing statements due to a behavioral
      change in SQLite 3.3.0.</li>
      <li>Added pager.c code necessary to cleanup after an encrypted file is closed.</li>
      <li>Fixed an encryption bug that caused a fault when an encrypted file was rolled
        back.</li>
      <li>Modified the testcase code to take advantage of optimizations regarding the use
        of a DbCommandBuilder.&nbsp; DataAdapter insert speed increased dramatically as
        a result.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>1.0.24.3 beta - January 10, 2006</b></p>

    <li>This beta is built from sqlite.org's 3.3.0 alpha and contains development-in-progress code.&nbsp; Therefore no guarantees
      can be made regarding its suitability for production use.</li><li>Added support for database encryption at the pager level.&nbsp; Databases
    are encrypted using a 128-bit RC4 stream algorithm.&nbsp; To open an existing encrypted
    database, you may now specify a "Password={password}" text in the ConnectionString,
    or you may call the SQLiteConnection.SetPassword() function to set the password
    on an open connection. &nbsp;To encrypt existing non-encrypted databases or to change
    the password on an encrypted database, you must use the SQLiteConnection.ChangePassword()
    function.&nbsp; If you use SetPassword() instead of specifying a password in the
    connection string, or call ChangePassword() you may use a binary byte array or a
    text string as the password.</li>
      <li>Rewrote the locking implementation for the Compact Framework.&nbsp; It is now
        more robust and incorporates into the SQLite codebase more efficiently than the
        previous CE adaptation.</li>
      <li>Moved some of the embedded schema XML data into a resource file to ease code readability.</li>
      <li>Automated the fixup of the original sqlite codebase's source prior to compiling,
        to ease merging with sqlite.org's source.</li>
      <li>Fixed a memory leak in SQLiteCommand due to it not removing an internal reference

    <p><b>1.0.24.2 - December 30, 2005</b></p>

      <li>SQLiteFunction static constructor was changed to pre-filter classes with only the
        SQLiteFunctionAttribute.&nbsp; The code was throwing an exception when certain
        assemblies were referenced in a project. </li>

        now has an additional overload to support it&nbsp;</li><li>Commands are now prepared as they are executed instead of beforehand.&nbsp; This
      fixes a bug whereby a multi-statement command that alters the database and subsequently
      references the altered data would fail during Prepare().</li><li>Tightened up the SQLiteDataReader to prevent reading columns before calling
    the first Read() and to prevent reading columns after the last Read().</li>

      or<strong> $</strong>.&nbsp; The designer will still use the <strong>$</strong>
      prefix however, since its more compatible with the default SQLite engine.</li><li>Added several alternate ISO8601 date/time formats to SQLiteConvert.cs to increase
    compatibility.</li>

      SQLite.Interop.DLL.&nbsp; This is the same core sqlite3 codebase but designed 
      specifically for this ADO.NET provider.&nbsp; This eliminates any possibility 
      of someone dropping another build of sqlite3.dll into the system and rendering 
      the provider inoperable.&nbsp; In the future if the folks at sqlite.org finally 
      introduce a method of retrieving column usage for an arbitrary prepared 
      statement, I'll retool this library to be a lightweight function call wrapper 
      around the core binary distribution.
      <LI>
      Added [SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurity] attribute to the UnsafeNativeMethods 
      class which brings VS2005 November CTP execution speeds inline with the 
      December CTP.
      <LI>
        Added a <B>bin</B>
      directory to the project root where pre-compiled binaries can be found.
      <LI>
        Added a <B>doc</B>
      directory where preliminary documentation on the class library can be found.
      <LI>
        Documented a lot more of the classes internally.

      Removed the SQLiteContext class and revamped the way UserFunctions work to 
      simplify the imlementation.
      <LI>
      Fixed a counting bug in the TestCases class, specifically in the function tests 
      where I wasn't resetting the counter and it was consequently reporting 
      intrinsic and raw select calls as being much much faster than they actually 
      were.&nbsp; The numbers are now much closer to what I expected for performance, 
      with .NET user-functions still being the slowest, but only by a small margin.
      <LI>
      Small performance tweaks to SQLiteDataReader.
      <LI>
      Added PageSize to the SQLiteConnectionStringBuilder and subsequently to the 
      SQLiteConnection
      <LI>
        Added a PRAGMA encoding=XXX execution statement to the SQLiteConnection after 
        opening a connection.

      Fixed up SQLiteCommandBuilder to correct implementation errors, which resulted 
      in an enormous performance boost in the InsertMany test.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,000 row 
      insert that executed in 1500ms now executes in 500ms.
      <LI>
      Fixed several errors in the SQLite3_UTF16 class.&nbsp; ToString() was working 
      incorrectly and the Open() method failed to register user defined functions and 
      collations.
      <LI>
      Fixed a bug in SQLiteCommand.ClearCommands() whereby only the first statement 
      was being properly cleaned up.
      <LI>
      Fixed a bug in SQLiteDataReader whereby calling NextResult() would not properly 
      reset the previously-executed command in the sequence.
      <LI>
        Added an InsertManyWithIdentityFetch test, which appends a select clause to 
        populate the ID of the last inserted row into the InsertCommand, demonstrating 
        ADO.NET's ability to auto-fetch identity columns on insert.

    <P><B>1.0.02 - Feb 21, 2005</B></P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
      Tweaks to the xxx_interop functions that return char *'s, so they also return 
      the length.&nbsp; Saves an interop call to get the UTF-8 string length during 
      conversion to a .NET string.
      <LI>
      Reworked the whole interop.c thing into interop.h and reduced the code required 
      to merge the main sqlite3 codebase.
      <LI>
        Added support for user-defined collations.
