【Archive Info】
    resource archive with directory structure within 
    original data may be one of PNG (CGs), Ogg (sound and voice), *.scn or *.adv (plain text scripts).

    	HEADER:
		s8 magic[4];		// "ARC1" or "ARC2"
            	u32 index_entries;	// file count
 	INDEX:
         	u32 length;	// data length in archive. for "ARC1", all data is non-compressed
                		// for "ARC2", the length may be uncompressed length or non-compressed length in archive, depend on reading the remarks in CONTENTS
         	u32 offset;    	// offset (from head of archive)
         	u8 name_length; // file name length (without the trailing zero terminator)
         	s8 *name;   	// file name
     	CONTENTS:
         	Following INDEX;
         	Because length of compressed data (comp_length) is not present, compr_length should be aquired by subtracting the offset from the current index entry by the one in the next entry.
         	If comp_length equals to the length field, then the data is non-compresed; otherwise it's compressed with LZSS.
         	For non-compressed data in "ARC2" archives, if it's not Ogg then the data is encrypted by inverting all bits
