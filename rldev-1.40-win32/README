-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

  If compiling from source, follow the instructions in INSTALL.

  For binary distributions, install files manually: the simplest way is just to
  untar the distribution into ~/rldev or /usr/local/share/rldev (depending on
  who needs access to it) and copy or symlink bin/rlc etc. into a suitable
  binary directory.  If when you try to run the program it complains that it
  cannot locate reallive.kfn, define an environment variable RLDEV pointing to
  the root of the installation directory.


Usage:

  Basic usage information can be obtained by running `kprl --help',
  `rlc --help', `vaconv --help', and `rlxml --help'.  For more detailed 
  information, refer to the manual.
